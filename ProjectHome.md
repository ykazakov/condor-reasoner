ConDOR is an experimental reasoner for ontologies based on a new kind of "consequence-based" reasoning procedure described in [this paper](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/people/frantisek.simancik/publications/IJCAI2011-ConDOR-paper.pdf).

Currently ConDOR supports a fragment of [OWL 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/) which corresponds to the description logic SH.
